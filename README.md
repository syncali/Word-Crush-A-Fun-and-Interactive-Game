# Word Crush: A Fun and Interactive Word Puzzle Game

Word Crush is an engaging puzzle game that combines word-finding strategy with tile-swapping mechanics. Players swap letter tiles strategically to create valid English words while managing limited moves and time.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Word Crush challenges you to create words by swapping adjacent letter tiles. The game features:

- A 6√ó6 grid of letter tiles with strategic letter distribution
- Score system based on Scrabble-style letter values
- Time limit of 3 minutes per game
- Limited moves (10) that must be used strategically
- Chain reaction mechanics when multiple words form
- Hint system to suggest optimal moves

## üìñ How to Play

1. **Objective**: Create valid English words (3+ letters) by swapping adjacent tiles to earn points
2. **Controls**: 
   - Click on a tile to select it
   - Click an adjacent tile to swap positions
   - Click the "Hint" button (up to 3 times per game) for move suggestions
3. **Scoring**:
   - Each letter has a point value (rare letters like Q, Z, X are worth more)
   - Longer words earn more points
   - Chain reactions occur when word removals create new words
